### HOW TO AUTHENTICATE IN MERCADOLIBRE API

1. Login into https://developers.mercadolibre.com.ar
2. Get the APP_ID and CLIENT_SECRET values from your test application
3. Export these values to be accesible from the example scripts
```BASH
    export APP_ID=<YOUR_APP_ID>
    export CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>
```
4. Execute the example `examples/authenticate.sh`. This will print the proper URL. Paste it in a browser and it'll ask for you to login to mercado libre. After login is succesfull it'll redirect you to a URL like `https://localhost:8080/?code=TG-...`. Get the `code` in the UrlParam and export it
```BASH
    export CLIENT_CODE=<YOUR_CLIENT_CODE>
``` 
5. You'll get a response like this one
```JSON
{"access_token":"APP_USR<REDACTED>","token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":21600,"scope":"offline_access read","user_id":45305128,"refresh_token":"TG-<REDACTED>"}
```
get the `access_token` field and export it
```BASH
    export ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

Now you can start running the examples in sequence.
